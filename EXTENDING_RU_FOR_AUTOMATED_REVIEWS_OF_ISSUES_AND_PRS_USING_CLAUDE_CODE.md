# Extending ru for Automated Reviews of GitHub Issues and PRs Using Claude Code

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive system for automating the review of GitHub issues and pull requests across multiple repositories using Claude Code as the AI agent. The goal is to transform a manual, time-consuming process into an orchestrated workflow that only surfaces decisions requiring human judgment.

**Key Innovation**: By leveraging Claude Code's stream-json output mode, ntm's sophisticated activity detection (velocity-based state classification with hysteresis), and a priority-scored question queue, we can process dozens of repositories in parallel while presenting a unified, intuitive interface for human decision-making.

## 1. Background: What is ru?

### 1.1 Overview

**ru (Repo Updater)** is a pure Bash CLI tool (~3,800 lines) for synchronizing GitHub repositories. It provides a beautiful, automation-friendly interface for managing collections of repositories - cloning new ones, pulling updates, checking status, and maintaining configuration.

### 1.2 Core Capabilities

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sync` | Clone missing repos and pull updates for existing ones |
| `status` | Show repository status without making changes |
| `import` | Import repos from files with auto visibility detection |
| `prune` | Find and manage orphan repositories |
| `add/remove` | Manage repository list |
| `self-update` | Update ru with checksum verification |
| `doctor` | System diagnostics |

### 1.3 Technical Implementation

ru is implemented as a single Bash script (`ru`) with these characteristics:

```bash
# Core design principles
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -uo pipefail  # NOT set -e (explicit error handling)

# Key architectural patterns:
# - XDG Base Directory Specification compliance
# - Git plumbing commands (not porcelain) for reliable status
# - Flock-based parallel sync work queue
# - NDJSON output for results tracking
# - Gum integration with ANSI fallback for TUI
# - Nameref-based function output (Bash 4.3+)
```

### 1.4 Configuration Structure

```
~/.config/ru/
├── config                 # Main configuration (PROJECTS_DIR, LAYOUT, etc.)
└── repos.d/
    ├── repos.txt          # Primary repository list
    ├── work.txt           # Work repositories
    └── personal.txt       # Personal projects

~/.local/state/ru/
├── sync-state.json        # Resume state for interrupted syncs
├── review-state.json      # Review tracking (NEW)
└── logs/                  # Operation logs
```

### 1.5 Repository Specification Format

```bash
# Basic formats
owner/repo                      # GitHub shorthand
owner/repo@develop              # Branch pinning
owner/repo as myname            # Custom local directory name
owner/repo@main as custom       # Combined

# Full URLs
https://github.com/owner/repo   # HTTPS
git@github.com:owner/repo       # SSH
https://gitlab.com/owner/repo   # Non-GitHub hosts
```

## 2. The Problem We're Solving

### 2.1 The Maintainer's Dilemma

Developers who create many open-source projects face an impossible scaling problem:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Volume** | Dozens or hundreds of repositories across domains |
| **Bandwidth** | No time for manual review of issues and PRs |
| **Quality** | Still want to maintain quality and respond to users |
| **Risk** | External contributions carry responsibility |
| **Context Switching** | Each repo requires deep understanding |
| **Staleness** | Issues become outdated as code evolves |

### 2.2 The Contribution Policy

The maintainer has adopted this policy (disclosed to users):

> *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.

### 2.3 Key Principles

1. **No Direct PR Merges**: External code is never merged directly
2. **Independent Verification**: AI validates independently - never trust user claims
3. **AI as Implementation**: Good ideas are implemented from scratch by AI
4. **Human Judgment for Direction**: Maintainer decides features/scope
5. **AI as Communicator**: AI responds via `gh` on maintainer's behalf
6. **Date Awareness**: Many issues are stale - check against recent commits

---

## 3. Current Manual Workflow

### 3.1 Step-by-Step Process

For each repository with open issues or PRs:

```bash
# 1. Navigate and update
cd ~/projects/myproject
git pull

# 2. Launch Claude Code
cc    # alias for claude-code CLI

# 3. Send codebase understanding prompt (wait ~5 min)
# 4. Send issue/PR review prompt (wait ~10-20 min)
# 5. Handle interactive questions from Claude
# 6. Repeat for next project
```

### 3.2 The Prompts

**Prompt 1: Codebase Understanding**
```
First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully
and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode
to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of
the project. Use ultrathink.
```

**Prompt 2: Issue/PR Review**
```
We don't allow PRs or outside contributions to this project as a matter
of policy; here is the policy disclosed to users:

> *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do
not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't
have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the
thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the
risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to
worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly
make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if
you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them
directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh`
and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in
particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid
wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the
prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but
it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.

But I want you to now use the `gh` utility to review all open issues and
PRs and to independently read and review each of these carefully; without
trusting or relying on any of the user reports being correct, or their
suggested/proposed changes or "fixes" being correct, I want you to do
your own totally separate and independent verification and validation.
You can use the stuff from users as possible inspiration, but everything
has to come from your own mind and/or official documentation and the
actual code and empirical, independent evidence. Note that MANY of these
are likely out of date because I made tons of fixes and changes already;
it's important to look at the dates and subsequent commits. Use ultrathink.
After you have reviewed things carefully and taken actions in response
(including implementing possible fixes or new features), you can respond
on my behalf using `gh`.

Just a reminder: we do NOT accept ANY PRs. You can look at them to see if
they contain good ideas but even then you must check with me first before
integrating even ideas because they could take the project into another
direction I don't like or introduce scope creep. Use ultrathink.
```

### 3.3 Pain Points

| Pain Point | Impact | Frequency |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Time per repo | 10-20+ minutes, fully attended | Every repo |
| Context switching | Mental overhead between projects | Constant |
| Interruption-driven | Claude asks questions needing immediate response | Frequent |
| No aggregation | Questions from different repos not consolidated | Always |
| No prioritization | Can't prioritize which repos need attention first | Always |
| No persistence | Must restart if interrupted | Occasionally |
| Session degradation | Claude slows down over long sessions | After 8-12 exchanges |

## 5. Architecture Options Analysis

### 5.1 Option A: Pure Bash Extension

**Approach**: Extend `ru` with a new `review` subcommand entirely in Bash.

```bash
cmd_review() {
    # Scan repos, launch tmux sessions, poll output, show gum prompts
}
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Keeps ru as pure Bash | Bash awkward for complex TUI |
| No new dependencies | Limited concurrency control |
| Simple deployment | Output parsing is fragile |
| | No real-time monitoring |
| | Reinvents ntm functionality |

**Verdict**: ❌ Not recommended for full implementation.

### 5.2 Option B: Standalone Go/Rust Helper Binary

**Approach**: Create `ru-review` as a separate binary.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Proper TUI support | New codebase to maintain |
| Better parsing/state | Duplicates ntm functionality |
| Good concurrency | More complex build/install |
| Type safety | Different language from ru |

**Verdict**: ⚠️ Reasonable but suboptimal given ntm exists.

### 5.3 Option C: Deep ntm Integration

**Approach**: Use ntm as orchestration engine, ru as repo management.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Mature orchestration (~29K lines Go) | Adds ntm as dependency |
| Beautiful TUI already exists | Requires ntm setup |
| Health monitoring, restart | Two-language coordination |
| Robot mode for Bash→Go communication | |
| Workflow pipelines | |
| Session persistence | |

**Verdict**: ✅ **Recommended** - leverages existing sophisticated tooling.

### 5.4 Option D: Hybrid with Graceful Degradation

**Approach**: Works with or without ntm.

- **Without ntm**: Sequential processing, gum-based TUI, basic functionality
- **With ntm**: Full parallel processing, rich dashboard, advanced features

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Works for all users | Two code paths to maintain |
| Enhanced experience with ntm | More testing required |
| Gradual adoption path | |

**Verdict**: ✅ **Selected** - Best balance of accessibility and power.

}
```

### 7.3 Phase 3: ntm Integration (Week 3-4)

#### 7.3.1 ntm Robot Mode API Usage

```bash
# Start review sessions using ntm
run_review_ntm_mode() {
    local repos=("$@")
    local session_name="ru-review-$$"
    local parallel_count="${REVIEW_PARALLEL:-4}"

    # Spawn ntm session with Claude agents
    local spawn_result
    spawn_result=$(ntm --robot-spawn "$session_name" \
        --cc="$parallel_count" \
        --working-dir="$PROJECTS_DIR" 2>/dev/null)

    if ! echo "$spawn_result" | jq -e '.success' >/dev/null; then
        log_error "Failed to spawn ntm session"
        log_error "$(echo "$spawn_result" | jq -r '.error // "Unknown error"')"
        return 1
    fi

    # Queue reviews using workflow pipelines
    local pane_index=1
    for repo_info in "${repos[@]}"; do
        local repo_spec issues prs
        IFS='|' read -r repo_spec issues prs <<< "$repo_info"

        local url branch custom_name local_path repo_id
        resolve_repo_spec "$repo_spec" "$PROJECTS_DIR" "$LAYOUT" \
            url branch custom_name local_path repo_id

        # Assign to pane using robot routing
        local route_result
        route_result=$(ntm --robot-route="$session_name" --type=cc 2>/dev/null)
        local target_pane
        target_pane=$(echo "$route_result" | jq -r '.recommendation.pane_id')

        # Send workflow to pane
        ntm workflow run github-review \
            --session="$session_name" \
            --pane="$target_pane" \
            --input repo_path="$local_path" \
            --input repo_name="$repo_id" \
            --async &

        ((pane_index++))
    done

    # Launch review dashboard
    run_review_dashboard "$session_name"
}

# Monitor session health
monitor_session_health() {
    local session_name="$1"

    while true; do
        local health
        health=$(ntm --robot-health="$session_name" 2>/dev/null)

        # Check for issues

        alerts=$(echo "$health" | jq -r '.alerts[]? // empty')

        if [[ -n "$alerts" ]]; then
            handle_health_alert "$session_name" "$alerts"
        fi

        # Check for rate limiting
        local rate_limited
        rate_limited=$(echo "$health" | jq -r '.sessions["'"$session_name"'"].agents | to_entries[] | select(.value.issue == "rate_limited") | .key')

        if [[ -n "$rate_limited" ]]; then
            handle_rate_limit "$session_name" "$rate_limited"
        fi

        sleep 10
    done
}
```

#### 7.3.2 Activity State Detection

ntm provides velocity-based activity detection with these thresholds:

```go
// From ntm internal/robot/activity.go
const (
    VelocityHighThreshold   = 10.0  // chars/sec - active generation
    VelocityMediumThreshold = 2.0   // chars/sec - some activity
    VelocityIdleThreshold   = 1.0   // chars/sec - considered idle
    DefaultStallThreshold   = 30 * time.Second
)
```

State classification priority:
1. **ERROR** (0.95 confidence): Error patterns detected immediately
2. **WAITING** (0.90 confidence): Idle prompt + velocity < 1.0 chars/sec
3. **THINKING** (0.80 confidence): Thinking indicators (spinners, "thinking...")
4. **GENERATING** (0.85 confidence): velocity > 10.0 chars/sec
5. **STALLED** (0.75 confidence): velocity == 0 for > 30 seconds while generating
6. **UNKNOWN** (0.50 confidence): Insufficient signals

### 7.4 Phase 4: TUI and Polish (Week 4-5)

See Section 12 for detailed TUI design.

## 8. Technical Deep Dive: Claude Code Automation

### 8.1 Claude Code Modes

| Mode | Command | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| Interactive | `claude` | Normal human interaction |
| Headless/Print | `claude -p "prompt"` | Scriptable, non-interactive |
| Stream JSON | `claude -p "..." --output-format stream-json` | Programmatic monitoring |

### 8.2 Stream-JSON Event Types

```json
// Initialization
{"type":"system","subtype":"init","session_id":"abc123","tools":["Read","Write","Edit","Bash",...]}

// Assistant message with text
{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"I'll analyze..."}]}}

// Assistant using a tool
{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_123","name":"Read","input":{"file_path":"/path/to/file"}}]}}

// Tool result
{"type":"user","message":{"content":[{"type":"tool_result","tool_use_id":"toolu_123","content":"file contents..."}]}}

// AskUserQuestion tool (CRITICAL for our use case)
{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[
  {"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_456","name":"AskUserQuestion","input":{
    "questions":[{
      "question":"Should I refactor the entire auth module or just fix the specific bug?",
      "header":"Approach",
      "options":[
        {"label":"Quick fix","description":"Fix only the reported bug (5 lines)"},
        {"label":"Full refactor","description":"Modernize entire auth module (200+ lines)"},
        {"label":"Skip","description":"Not a priority right now"}
      ],
      "multiSelect":false
    }]
  }}
]}}

// Session complete
{"type":"result","status":"success","duration_ms":45000,"session_id":"abc123"}
```

### 8.3 Key Automation Patterns

```bash
# Pattern 1: Detect AskUserQuestion in stream
detect_question() {
    local line="$1"
    echo "$line" | jq -e '.message.content[]? | select(.name == "AskUserQuestion")' >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# Pattern 2: Extract question for display
format_question_for_display() {
    local question_json="$1"
    local repo_name="$2"

    local question options_text
    question=$(echo "$question_json" | jq -r '.questions[0].question')

    # Format options
    options_text=""
    local i=0
    while IFS= read -r opt; do
        local label desc
        label=$(echo "$opt" | jq -r '.label')
        desc=$(echo "$opt" | jq -r '.description // ""')
        options_text+="  $((++i))) $label"
        [[ -n "$desc" ]] && options_text+=" - $desc"
        options_text+=$'\n'
    done < <(echo "$question_json" | jq -c '.questions[0].options[]')

    cat << EOF
Repository: $repo_name

$question

Options:
$options_text
EOF

### 8.4 Known Limitations and Workarounds

| Limitation | Workaround |
|------------|------------|
| `--output-format stream-json` may miss final event | Poll for completion, set timeout |
| Sessions degrade after 8-12 exchanges | Use `/compact` or start fresh |
| Rate limits (429) | Exponential backoff, rotate between sessions |
| Long thinking periods (10+ min) | Set `--max-turns`, implement timeout |
| Slash commands not available in `-p` mode | Describe task instead |

## 9. Technical Deep Dive: ntm Integration

### 9.1 Robot Mode API Reference

| Command | Output Type | Key Fields |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `--robot-status` | StatusOutput | sessions, agents, system info |
| `--robot-health=session` | HealthOutput | agent health matrix, alerts |
| `--robot-activity=paneID` | ActivityOutput | state, velocity, confidence |
| `--robot-route=session` | RouteOutput | best pane recommendation |
| `--robot-send` | SendOutput | delivery confirmation |
| `--robot-snapshot=session` | SnapshotOutput | full pane state |

### 9.2 Health Monitoring

ntm detects these conditions automatically:

| Condition | Detection | Recovery |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Stall** | No output for 5+ minutes | Soft restart (Ctrl+C) |
| **Rate Limit** | Pattern: "rate limit", "429", "quota exceeded" | Backoff + alert |
| **Crash** | Pattern: "panic:", "SIGSEGV", "killed" | Auto-restart |
| **Auth Failure** | Pattern: "unauthorized", "invalid.*key" | Alert user |
| **Network Error** | Pattern: "connection refused", "timed out" | Retry with backoff |

      We don't allow PRs or outside contributions to this project as a matter
      of policy; here is the policy disclosed to users:

      > *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do
      not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't
      have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the
      thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the
      risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to
      worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly
      make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if
      you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them
      directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh`
      and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in
      particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid
      wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the
      prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but
      it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.

      But I want you to now use the `gh` utility to review all open issues and
      PRs and to independently read and review each of these carefully; without
      trusting or relying on any of the user reports being correct, or their
      suggested/proposed changes or "fixes" being correct, I want you to do
      your own totally separate and independent verification and validation.
      You can use the stuff from users as possible inspiration, but everything
      has to come from your own mind and/or official documentation and the
      actual code and empirical, independent evidence. Note that MANY of these
      are likely out of date because I made tons of fixes and changes already;
      it's important to look at the dates and subsequent commits. Use ultrathink.
      After you have reviewed things carefully and taken actions in response
      (including implementing possible fixes or new features), you can respond
      on my behalf using `gh`.

      Just a reminder: we do NOT accept ANY PRs. You can look at them to see if
      they contain good ideas but even then you must check with me first before
      integrating even ideas because they could take the project into another
      direction I don't like or introduce scope creep. Use ultrathink.

## 10. Performance Optimization Strategies

### 10.1 GitHub API Optimization

```bash
# Batch queries to reduce API calls
batch_fetch_repo_activity() {
    local repos=("$@")

    # Use GraphQL for batch queries (much faster than REST)
    local query='query($repos: [String!]!) {
      repositories: nodes(ids: $repos) {
        ... on Repository {
          nameWithOwner
          issues(states: OPEN) { totalCount }
          pullRequests(states: OPEN) { totalCount }
        }
      }
    }'

    # Execute batch query
    gh api graphql -f query="$query" \
        -f repos="$(printf '%s\n' "${repos[@]}" | jq -R . | jq -s .)"
}

# Cache with intelligent TTL
CACHE_TTL_ACTIVE=300     # 5 min for repos with activity
CACHE_TTL_INACTIVE=3600  # 1 hour for repos without activity
```

### 10.2 Parallel Session Management

```bash
# Optimal parallelism calculation
calculate_optimal_parallelism() {
    local total_repos="$1"

    # Factors:
    # - API rate limits (5000/hour for authenticated)
    # - Claude rate limits (varies by tier)
    # - System resources (memory, CPU)
    # - Context quality (too many sessions = divided attention)

    local max_by_rate_limit=10      # Conservative API limit
    local max_by_resources=8        # Based on typical system
    local max_by_quality=6          # Optimal for attention

    local optimal=$((total_repos < max_by_quality ? total_repos : max_by_quality))
    optimal=$((optimal < max_by_resources ? optimal : max_by_resources))
    optimal=$((optimal < max_by_rate_limit ? optimal : max_by_rate_limit))

    echo "$optimal"
}
```

### 10.3 Pre-fetching Strategy

```bash
# While reviewing repo N, pre-fetch data for repo N+1, N+2
prefetch_next_repos() {
    local current_index="$1"
    local repos=("${@:2}")
    local prefetch_count=2

    for ((i=1; i<=prefetch_count; i++)); do
        local next_index=$((current_index + i))
        if [[ $next_index -lt ${#repos[@]} ]]; then
            local next_repo="${repos[next_index]}"

            # Background fetch
            (
                get_repo_activity_cached "$next_repo" >/dev/null
                # Also warm git fetch
                local local_path
                local_path=$(get_repo_local_path "$next_repo")
                [[ -d "$local_path" ]] && git -C "$local_path" fetch --quiet 2>/dev/null
            ) &
        fi
    done
}
```

### 10.4 Smart Session Reuse

```bash
# Reuse existing Claude sessions when possible
get_or_create_session() {
    local repo_path="$1"
    local session_id="$2"

    # Check for existing session with context
    if ntm --robot-status 2>/dev/null | jq -e ".sessions[\"$session_id\"]" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        local context_usage
        context_usage=$(ntm --robot-activity="$session_id:1" 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.context_usage // 100')

        if (( $(echo "$context_usage < 70" | bc -l) )); then
            # Reuse existing session
            echo "$session_id"
            return 0
        fi
    fi

    # Create new session
    create_new_session "$repo_path" "$session_id"
}
```

## 11. Priority Scoring Algorithm

### 11.1 Score Components

```python
# Pseudo-code for clarity (implemented in Bash)

def calculate_priority_score(repo):
    score = 0

    # Component 1: Issue/PR Volume (0-100 points)
    score += min(repo.open_issues * 10, 50)
    score += min(repo.open_prs * 20, 50)

    # Component 2: Label-Based Priority (0-100 points)
    for label in repo.labels:
        if label in ['security', 'critical']:
            score += 50
        elif label in ['bug', 'urgent']:
            score += 30
        elif label in ['enhancement', 'feature']:
            score += 10

    # Component 3: Age Factor (0-50 points)
    oldest_issue_days = repo.get_oldest_issue_age_days()
    if oldest_issue_days > 60:
        score += 50
    elif oldest_issue_days > 30:
        score += 30
    elif oldest_issue_days > 14:
        score += 15

    # Component 4: Staleness Penalty (0-40 points)
    days_since_review = repo.get_days_since_last_review()
    if days_since_review > 60:
        score += 40
    elif days_since_review > 30:
        score += 25
    elif days_since_review > 14:
        score += 10

    # Component 5: Engagement Signal (0-30 points)
    # High engagement = users care about this repo
    recent_comments = repo.get_comment_count_last_7_days()
    if recent_comments > 10:
        score += 30
    elif recent_comments > 5:
        score += 15
    elif recent_comments > 0:
        score += 5

    # Component 6: PR vs Issue Preference (0-20 points)
    # PRs indicate someone invested effort
    if repo.open_prs > 0:
        score += 20

    return score
```

### 11.2 Priority Thresholds

| Score Range | Priority Level | Color | Behavior |
|-------------|----------------|-------|----------|
| 150+ | CRITICAL | Red | Process immediately |
| 100-149 | HIGH | Orange | Process in first batch |
| 50-99 | NORMAL | Yellow | Process when capacity available |
| 0-49 | LOW | Gray | Process last or skip if `--skip-low` |

### 11.3 Bash Implementation

```bash
calculate_priority_score() {
    local repo_id="$1"
    local issues="${2:-0}"
    local prs="${3:-0}"

    local score=0

    # Volume component
    local vol_issues=$((issues * 10))
    [[ $vol_issues -gt 50 ]] && vol_issues=50
    local vol_prs=$((prs * 20))
    [[ $vol_prs -gt 50 ]] && vol_prs=50
    score=$((score + vol_issues + vol_prs))

    # Label component (requires API call - cached)
    local label_score=0
    local labels
    labels=$(gh issue list -R "$repo_id" --state open --json labels --jq '.[].labels[].name' 2>/dev/null | sort -u)
    if echo "$labels" | grep -qiE 'security|critical'; then
        label_score=50
    elif echo "$labels" | grep -qiE 'bug|urgent'; then
        label_score=30
    elif echo "$labels" | grep -qiE 'enhancement|feature'; then
        label_score=10
    fi
    score=$((score + label_score))

    # Age component
    local oldest_days
    oldest_days=$(get_oldest_issue_age "$repo_id")
    if [[ $oldest_days -gt 60 ]]; then
        score=$((score + 50))
    elif [[ $oldest_days -gt 30 ]]; then
        score=$((score + 30))
    elif [[ $oldest_days -gt 14 ]]; then
        score=$((score + 15))
    fi

    # Staleness component
    local days_since_review
    days_since_review=$(get_days_since_review "$repo_id")
    if [[ $days_since_review -gt 60 ]]; then
        score=$((score + 40))
    elif [[ $days_since_review -gt 30 ]]; then
        score=$((score + 25))
    elif [[ $days_since_review -gt 14 ]]; then
        score=$((score + 10))
    fi

    # PR bonus
    [[ $prs -gt 0 ]] && score=$((score + 20))

    echo "$score"
}

get_priority_level() {
    local score="$1"
    if [[ $score -ge 150 ]]; then echo "CRITICAL"
    elif [[ $score -ge 100 ]]; then echo "HIGH"
    elif [[ $score -ge 50 ]]; then echo "NORMAL"
    else echo "LOW"
    fi
}
```

### 12.3 Basic Mode (gum-based)

```bash
show_question_basic_mode() {
    local repo="$1"
    local question="$2"
    local options_json="$3"

    echo ""
    gum style --border rounded --padding "1 2" --border-foreground "#fab387" \

        local label desc
        label=$(echo "$opt" | jq -r '.label')
        desc=$(echo "$opt" | jq -r '.description // ""')
        if [[ -n "$desc" ]]; then
            option_labels+=("$label - $desc")
        else

## 13. Error Handling and Recovery

### 13.1 Error Categories

| Category | Examples | Recovery Strategy |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Transient** | Network timeout, API 500 | Retry with exponential backoff |
| **Rate Limit** | API 429, Claude quota | Backoff, rotate sessions, alert |
| **Auth** | Token expired, invalid key | Alert user, pause session |
| **Session** | Claude crash, OOM | Auto-restart, preserve state |
| **User** | Invalid input, cancel | Graceful handling, resume |
| **Fatal** | Disk full, permissions | Abort with clear message |

### 13.2 Retry Strategy

```bash
# Exponential backoff with jitter
retry_with_backoff() {
    local cmd="$1"
    local max_attempts="${2:-5}"
    local base_delay="${3:-1}"

    local attempt=1
    while [[ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]]; do
        if eval "$cmd"; then
            return 0
        fi

        local delay=$((base_delay * (2 ** (attempt - 1))))
        # Add jitter (±25%)
        local jitter=$((delay / 4))
        delay=$((delay + RANDOM % (jitter * 2) - jitter))

        log_warn "Attempt $attempt failed, retrying in ${delay}s..."
        sleep "$delay"
        ((attempt++))
    done

    return 1
}
```

### 13.3 Session Recovery

```bash
# Checkpoint state periodically
checkpoint_review_state() {
    local state_file="$RU_STATE_DIR/review-checkpoint.json"

    local state
    state=$(cat << EOF
{
  "version": 1,
  "timestamp": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "run_id": "$REVIEW_RUN_ID",
  "mode": "$REVIEW_MODE",
  "repos_total": ${#REVIEW_REPOS[@]},
  "repos_completed": ${#COMPLETED_REPOS[@]},
  "repos_pending": $(printf '%s\n' "${PENDING_REPOS[@]}" | jq -R . | jq -s .),
  "questions_pending": $(echo "$QUESTIONS_JSON" | jq .),
  "sessions": $(get_active_sessions_json)
}
EOF
)
    echo "$state" > "$state_file"
}

# Resume from checkpoint
resume_from_checkpoint() {
    local checkpoint_file="$RU_STATE_DIR/review-checkpoint.json"

    if [[ ! -f "$checkpoint_file" ]]; then
        log_error "No checkpoint found to resume"
        return 1
    fi

    local state
    state=$(cat "$checkpoint_file")

    # Restore state
    REVIEW_RUN_ID=$(echo "$state" | jq -r '.run_id')
    REVIEW_MODE=$(echo "$state" | jq -r '.mode')

    # Restore pending repos
    PENDING_REPOS=()
    while IFS= read -r repo; do
        PENDING_REPOS+=("$repo")
    done < <(echo "$state" | jq -r '.repos_pending[]')

    log_info "Resumed from checkpoint: ${#PENDING_REPOS[@]} repos remaining"
}
```

### 13.4 Graceful Degradation

```bash
# Fallback chain for mode selection
select_best_mode() {
    # Try ntm first
    if command -v ntm &>/dev/null; then
        if ntm --robot-status &>/dev/null; then
            echo "ntm"
            return
        fi
        log_warn "ntm available but not responding, falling back"
    fi

    # Try stream-json mode
    if claude --version &>/dev/null; then
        echo "stream"
        return
    fi

    # Fall back to basic
    echo "basic"
}
```

---

## 14. Security Considerations

### 14.1 Authentication and Tokens

| Token | Storage | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|---------|------|------------|
| GitHub (gh) | gh's secure store | Medium | Use gh CLI, never store raw |
| Anthropic API | System keychain | High | Environment variable, not file |
| ntm sessions | Local only | Low | Tmux session security |

### 14.2 Code Execution Safety

```bash
# Claude operates in sandboxed repos
# - Only allowed tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, gh
# - Bash commands reviewed before execution
# - No network access except gh API
# - Changes are local until pushed

# Validation before push
validate_before_push() {
    local repo_path="$1"

    # Check for sensitive patterns
    if git -C "$repo_path" diff --cached | grep -qiE 'password|secret|api.?key|token'; then
        log_warn "Potential sensitive data detected in changes"
        return 1
    fi

    # Run any configured pre-push hooks
    if [[ -x "$repo_path/.git/hooks/pre-push" ]]; then
        "$repo_path/.git/hooks/pre-push"
    fi
}
```

### 14.3 Data Privacy

```bash
# What's logged (review-state.json)
# - Repo names (public info)
# - Issue/PR numbers (public info)
# - Decision metadata (your choices)
# - Timestamps

# What's NOT logged
# - Full issue content
# - PR code
# - API tokens
# - File contents
# - Session transcripts (stored separately with restricted permissions)
```

### 14.4 Rate Limit Management

```bash
# Track API usage to avoid rate limiting
track_api_usage() {
    local api="$1"  # github, anthropic
    local cost="${2:-1}"

    local usage_file="$RU_STATE_DIR/api-usage-${api}.json"
    local now
    now=$(date +%s)

    # Clean old entries (older than 1 hour)
    if [[ -f "$usage_file" ]]; then
        jq --arg cutoff "$((now - 3600))" \
           '[.[] | select(.ts > ($cutoff | tonumber))]' \
           "$usage_file" > "${usage_file}.tmp"
        mv "${usage_file}.tmp" "$usage_file"
    else
        echo "[]" > "$usage_file"
    fi

    # Add new entry
    jq --arg ts "$now" --arg cost "$cost" \
       '. + [{"ts": ($ts | tonumber), "cost": ($cost | tonumber)}]' \
       "$usage_file" > "${usage_file}.tmp"
    mv "${usage_file}.tmp" "$usage_file"

    # Check if approaching limit
    local total
    total=$(jq '[.[].cost] | add // 0' "$usage_file")

    case "$api" in
        github)
            if [[ $total -gt 4500 ]]; then  # 5000/hour limit
                log_warn "Approaching GitHub API rate limit: $total/5000"
            fi
            ;;
        anthropic)
            if [[ $total -gt 900 ]]; then  # Varies by tier
                log_warn "Approaching Anthropic rate limit"
            fi
            ;;
    esac
}

## 16. Real-World Edge Cases

### 16.1 Stale Issues

**Scenario**: Issue reports bug that was already fixed.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Check issue date against recent commits
2. Search for related fixes in git log
3. Attempt to reproduce the bug
4. If fixed: Comment explaining fix commit, close issue
5. If still present: Proceed with fix
```

### 16.2 Duplicate Issues

**Scenario**: Multiple issues report same problem.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Search for similar issue titles/descriptions
2. Check if issues share keywords/symptoms
3. If duplicates found:
   - Keep oldest issue as primary
   - Comment on duplicates linking to primary
   - Close duplicates with "Duplicate of #X"
```

### 16.3 Can't Reproduce Bug

**Scenario**: Issue describes problem Claude can't verify.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Document reproduction attempts
2. Ask specific questions via gh comment:
   - OS/environment details
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Error messages/logs
3. Add "needs-info" label
4. Queue for follow-up in next review
```

### 16.4 Hostile/Rude Users

**Scenario**: User is aggressive or disrespectful.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Focus only on technical content
2. Respond professionally, ignore tone
3. If purely hostile with no content:
   - Close without engagement
   - Don't explain or justify
4. Flag for human review if threatening
```

### 16.5 Scope Creep in Feature Requests

**Scenario**: Feature request is large/invasive.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Acknowledge the idea's merits
2. Explain scope concerns
3. Ask maintainer for direction:
   "This would add 500+ lines and a new dependency.
    Options:
    a) Implement as proposed
    b) Implement minimal version
    c) Decline as out of scope"
```

### 16.6 PR with Good Idea, Bad Implementation

**Scenario**: PR concept is good but code is wrong.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Thank user for the idea
2. Explain the policy (no direct merges)
3. Describe what will happen:
   "I'll implement this independently,
    incorporating your concept with
    proper error handling/tests."
4. Implement from scratch
5. Credit user in commit message
6. Close PR referencing new commit
```

### 16.7 Security Vulnerability

**Scenario**: Issue reports security problem.

```
Claude's approach:
1. CRITICAL priority - process immediately
2. Verify independently
3. If valid:
   - Implement fix without public details
   - Coordinate disclosure with maintainer
   - Credit reporter appropriately
4. If not valid:
   - Explain why (without confirming specifics)
   - Thank for responsible disclosure attempt
```

## 17. Risk Mitigation

### 17.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Claude API changes | Medium | High | Version detection, fallback modes |
| ntm incompatibility | Low | Medium | Graceful degradation to basic mode |
| Rate limiting | High | Medium | Backoff, caching, quota tracking |
| Session instability | Medium | Medium | Checkpointing, auto-recovery |
| Output parsing errors | Low | Low | Pattern validation, graceful handling |

### 17.2 User Experience Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Information overload | Medium | Medium | Priority scoring, progressive disclosure |
| Lost context | Low | High | Full session drill-down, output logging |
