XDG compliance solves this elegantly - config lives in ~/.config/ru/, data in ~/.local/share/ru/, cache in ~/.cache/ru/, and state in ~/.local/state/ru/.\n\n## Configuration Resolution Order\n1. Command-line arguments (--dir, --layout)\n2. Environment variables (RU_PROJECTS_DIR, RU_LAYOUT)\n3. Config file (~/.config/ru/config)\n4. Built-in defaults\n\nThis order is critical: CLI always wins, then env (for CI), then file (for user prefs), then defaults.\n\n## Key Config Values\n- PROJECTS_DIR: Where repos live (default: /data/projects)\n- LAYOUT: flat|owner-repo|full (default: flat for backwards compat)\n- UPDATE_STRATEGY: ff-only|rebase|merge (default: ff-only for safety)\n- AUTOSTASH: Whether to auto-stash before pull (default: false)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- `ru init` creates config directory and files\n- Config values resolve correctly through the priority chain\n- User can override any value via CLI, env, or file","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-03T16:10:05.881422408-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T16:22:47.459277496-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-03T16:22:47.459277496-05:00","close_reason":"Configuration System EPIC complete - all config functions implemented","labels":["config","xdg"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-3","depends_on_id":"bd-2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-03T16:13:08.982275423-05:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}]}

When someone runs `ru sync --json | jq .`, they need clean JSON on stdout without progress messages mixed in. Conversely, interactive users need beautiful, informative progress output. Stream separation makes both possible.\n\n## Stream Rules\n- stderr: log_info, log_warn, log_error, log_step, log_success, banners, summaries\n- stdout: JSON output (--json mode), repo paths (default mode)\n\n## Per-Repo Logging\nEach repo's git output goes to a dated log file: ~/.local/state/ru/logs/YYYY-MM-DD/repos/owner_repo.log. This allows debugging without cluttering terminal output.\n\n## NDJSON Result Tracking\nDuring runs, we write newline-delimited JSON records to a temp file. This allows aggregation for summary reports without holding everything in memory.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Running `ru sync 2\u003e/dev/null` produces only structured output\n- Running `ru sync --json 2\u003e\u00261` shows progress on stderr, JSON on stdout\n- Per-repo logs are written and accessible","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-03T16:10:05.881422408-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T16:33:49.632565691-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-03T16:33:49.632565691-05:00","close_reason":"Logging functions implemented in Phase 2 skeleton","labels":["logging","output"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-4","depends_on_id":"bd-2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-03T16:14:08.049523389-05:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}]}

With 50+ repos, each with potential open issues and PRs, comprehensive review becomes impossible.\n\n## Solution: `ru review` Command\nA new command that:\n1. **Discovers** open issues/PRs across all configured repos (GraphQL batched)\n2. **Prioritizes** work items by urgency (security \u003e bugs \u003e features)\n3. **Prepares** isolated worktrees for safe AI edits\n4. **Orchestrates** parallel Claude Code sessions in Plan Mode\n5. **Aggregates** questions from all sessions into unified TUI\n6. **Applies** approved changes with quality gates\n\n## Key Architectural Decisions\n\n### Plan → Apply Split (Safety by Default)\n- Plan mode: Agent creates patches + review-plan.json artifact\n- Agent CANNOT run gh mutations (comment/close/merge/label)\n- Apply mode: ru executes approved actions from plan artifact\n- Quality gates (tests/lint) must pass before push\n\n### Work Item Model (Not Repo-Level)\n- Score individual issues/PRs, not whole repos\n- Priority factors: type, labels, age, recency, staleness\n- Prevents high-volume repos from dominating queue\n\n### Unified Session Driver Interface\n- Supports ntm (advanced orchestration) AND local (tmux + stream-json)\n- Same interface, graceful degradation if ntm unavailable\n- Enables development without full ntm dependency\n\n### Worktree Isolation\n- Each repo gets isolated worktree for AI edits\n- Main repo stays untouched until explicit apply\n- Enables easy rollback (just delete worktree)\n\n### Repo Digest Cache\n- Persistent summary of each repo's architecture\n- Eliminates repetitive \"understand codebase\" work\n- Delta updates based on commits since last review\n\n### Rate-Limit Governor\n- Adaptive concurrency based on REAL API limits\n- Queries GitHub API for actual remaining quota\n- Detects model rate limits from 429 responses\n- Circuit breaker for cascading failures\n\n## Success Metrics\n- Review 50+ repos in single session\n- \u003c 30 seconds human response time per question\n- Zero accidental mutations (Plan mode enforcement)\n- 90%+ of routine issues handled without escalation\n\n## Dependencies\n- Claude Code with stream-json output support\n- GitHub CLI (gh) for API access\n- tmux for session management\n- Optional: ntm for advanced orchestration\n\n## Phases\n1. Core Infrastructure (cmd_review, GraphQL, worktrees)\n2. Claude Code Integration (stream-json, question detection)\n3. ntm Integration (robot mode, activity detection)\n4. TUI (dashboard, drill-down, keyboard shortcuts)\n5. Apply Phase (quality gates, gh_actions, push)\n6. Error Handling (retry, checkpoint, recovery)\n7.

Detect and extract questions for human review.\n\n## Why This Phase Second\n- Phase 1 provides the foundation (worktrees, work items)\n- Now we need to actually run Claude Code sessions\n- Stream-JSON enables programmatic control\n- Question detection is core to human-in-the-loop\n\n## Key Insight: Stream-JSON Mode\nClaude Code's stream-json mode outputs structured events:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"system\",\"subtype\":\"init\",\"session_id\":\"abc123\"}\n{\"type\":\"assistant\",\"message\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"...\"}]}}\n{\"type\":\"assistant\",\"message\":{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"tool_use\",\"name\":\"AskUserQuestion\",\"input\":{...}}]}}\n{\"type\":\"result\",\"status\":\"success\"}\n```\n\nThis enables:\n- Detecting when Claude asks questions\n- Extracting structured question data\n- Monitoring progress without scraping terminal\n- Knowing when session completes\n\n## Components\n\n### 2.1 Unified Session Driver Interface\nAbstract interface that both ntm and local drivers implement:\n- start_session(repo_ctx) → session_id\n- send_to_session(session_id, message)\n- stream_session(session_id) → events via callback\n- interrupt_session(session_id)\n- stop_session(session_id)\n\n### 2.2 Local Driver (tmux + stream-json)\nFallback when ntm not available:\n- Launch Claude in tmux session\n- Pipe output through tee to log file\n- Parse stream-json events\n- Route answers via tmux send-keys\n\n### 2.3 Stream-JSON Event Parsing\nParse NDJSON stream from Claude:\n- Detect init events (session started)\n- Detect assistant events (text, tool_use)\n- Detect AskUserQuestion tool calls\n- Detect result events (session complete)\n\n### 2.4 Question Detection (3 Wait Reasons)\nThree types of \"waiting for input\" states:\n\n1. **AskUserQuestion tool call** (highest priority)\n   - Structured with options, multiSelect\n   - Best UX - can render nicely\n\n2. **Agent question in text** (medium priority)\n   - \"Should I...\", \"Do you want...\", \"Which...\"\n   - Parse from text, may need clarification\n\n3. **External prompt** (lowest priority)\n   - Git conflict, SSH passphrase, auth prompt\n   - May require different handling\n\n### 2.5 Review Plan Artifact Schema\nDefine the contract between agent and apply phase:\n```json\n{\n  \"schema_version\": 1,\n  \"run_id\": \"...\",\n  \"repo\": \"owner/repo\",\n  \"items\": [...],\n  \"questions\": [...],\n  \"git\": {...},\n  \"gh_actions\": [...]\n}\n```\n\n### 2.6 Agent Prompt Engineering\nCraft prompts that:\n- Tell Claude about project policy (no PRs)\n- Instruct independent verification\n- Require review-plan.json artifact\n- Block gh mutations in Plan mode\n- Use ultrathink for deep analysis\n\n## Exit Criteria\n- Local driver can launch Claude session\n- Stream-JSON events parsed correctly\n- AskUserQuestion detected and extracted\n- Review plan artifact created by agent\n- Questions queued for human review\n\n## Estimated Effort\n~400-500 lines of Bash","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-04T15:20:42.271613589-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-04T18:01:38.559400404-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-04T18:01:38.559400404-05:00","close_reason":"All Phase 2 components complete: driver interface (bd-jm89), local driver (bd-9s7y), stream-JSON (bd-8zt6), question detection (bd-4ps0), review plan (bd-koxf)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-5yy3","depends_on_id":"bd-0vm5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-04T15:45:26.642348046-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

But automatically installing system packages is invasive and breaks trust. We detect, inform, and prompt - never auto-install unless explicitly requested.\n\n## Dependency Flow\n1. Check if gh is installed (command -v gh)\n2. If missing and can_prompt(): offer to install with user confirmation\n3. If missing and non-interactive: fail with clear instructions\n4. If installed: check if authenticated (gh auth status)\n5. If not authed and can_prompt(): offer to run gh auth login\n6. If not authed and non-interactive: fail with GH_TOKEN instructions\n\n## Non-Interactive Mode\nCI/automation needs `--non-interactive` to never hang on prompts. In this mode, missing deps or auth always fails immediately with actionable error messages.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Interactive mode prompts for missing deps\n- Non-interactive mode fails cleanly with instructions\n- `ru doctor` reports all dependency status clearly","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-03T16:10:05.881422408-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T16:31:52.086156196-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-03T16:31:52.086156196-05:00","close_reason":"All dependency management functions implemented: check_gh_installed, check_gh_auth, ensure_dependencies, detect_os","labels":["deps","gh"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-6","depends_on_id":"bd-5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-03T16:14:08.132125739-05:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}]}

{"id":"bd-6nuc","title":"Implement per-repo configuration loading","description":"Implements load_repo_agent_config() to support per-repository agent-sweep customization.\n\n## Background\n\nThe NTM integration plan specifies support for per-repo .ru-agent.yml or .ru-agent.json files that can override default agent-sweep behavior. This enables repository maintainers to:\n- Enable/disable agent sweeps for their repo\n- Customize file denylist patterns\n- Set repo-specific size limits\n- Configure custom phase prompts or skip certain phases\n- Define pre/post hooks\n\n## Function to Implement\n\n### load_repo_agent_config()\n\nPurpose: Load and merge per-repo configuration with global defaults.\n\nLocation: ~/.config/ru/agent-sweep.yml (global) merged with repo/.ru-agent.yml\n\nConfig Schema:\n```yaml\n# Enable/disable for this repo\nenabled: true\n\n# Override file patterns to deny\nfile_denylist_extra:\n  - \"*.generated.ts\"\n  - \"vendor/*\"\n\n# Override file size limit (bytes)\nmax_file_size: 5242880  # 5MB\n\n# Skip phases\nskip_phases:\n  - release  # Skip phase 3 for this repo\n\n# Custom understanding context\nextra_context: |\n  This repo uses a monorepo structure.\n  Database migrations are in db/migrations/.\n\n# Hooks (run in repo context)\npre_sweep_hook: \"./scripts/pre-agent.sh\"\npost_sweep_hook: \"./scripts/post-agent.sh\"\n```\n\nImplementation Steps:\n1. Check for .ru-agent.yml or .ru-agent.json in repo root\n2. Parse YAML/JSON using portable approach (yq -\u003e python3 -\u003e simple parser)\n3. Merge with global config (repo overrides global)\n4. Validate configuration values\n5. Return merged config as associative array or temp file\n\n## Portable YAML Parsing\n\nSince this is pure Bash, implement layered fallback:\n1. yq (if available) - fastest, most reliable\n2. python3 -c \"import yaml...\" (common fallback)\n3. Simple key: value parser for flat configs\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- Missing config file is NOT an error (use defaults)\n- Invalid YAML/JSON should warn but not fail the sweep\n- Unknown keys should warn but be ignored\n- Validate types (numbers are numbers, booleans are booleans)\n\n## Related Beads\n\n- Parent epic: bd-mkoc (Agent Sweep Command Implementation)\n- Used by: bd-kczb (cmd_agent_sweep main function)\n- Used by: bd-b00c (run_single_agent_workflow)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Loads .ru-agent.yml from repo root if present\n- [ ] Falls back to .ru-agent.json if YAML not found\n- [ ] Merges repo config with global defaults correctly\n- [ ] Unknown keys logged but do not cause failure\n- [ ] Invalid config values produce clear warnings\n- [ ] Works without yq installed (python3 fallback)\n- [ ] Works without python3 installed (simple parser fallback)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-06T17:22:02.187186112-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-06T19:14:42.189503901-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-06T19:14:42.189503901-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented load_repo_agent_config() with yq/python3/jq fallbacks, should_skip_phase(), and get_combined_denylist() helper functions.

Git plumbing commands give deterministic, parseable output. We use `git rev-list --left-right --count` for ahead/behind, `git status --porcelain` for dirty detection.\n\n## Key Patterns\n- Always use `git -C \"$repo_path\"` instead of cd\n- Capture output with `if output=$(git ... 2\u003e\u00261); then ... else exit_code=$?; fi`\n- Check for divergence by comparing old_head vs new_head after pull\n- Support multiple strategies: ff-only (safe default), rebase, merge\n\n## Remote Mismatch Detection\nIf a local repo exists but origin URL differs from expected, we warn and skip. This prevents accidentally overwriting unrelated repos.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Clone operations work with proper error handling\n- Pull operations detect all status conditions (current, updated, diverged, conflict)\n- No string parsing of user-facing git messages","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-03T16:10:05.881422408-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T16:26:52.457035826-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-03T16:26:52.457035826-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented all git operations: is_git_repo, get_repo_status, get_remote_url, check_remote_mismatch, do_clone, do_pull, do_fetch.

System Context (AGENTS.md Reading)\n   First read ALL of AGENTS.md and README.md carefully.\n   Use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code,\n   technical architecture, and purpose of the project.

Digest Handling\n   If prior digest exists: read it, update based on delta commits\n   If no digest: create comprehensive fresh digest\n   Always write updated digest to .ru/repo-digest.md\n\n3. Policy Communication\n   POLICY: We do not accept PRs or outside contributions. The maintainer\n   policy is disclosed to users. Claude reviews and independently decides\n   whether and how to address submissions. Bug reports are welcome.\n\n4. Review Instructions\n   For each work item:\n   - Read via gh issue view or gh pr view\n   - Verify claims independently - do not trust user reports blindly\n   - Check dates against recent commits (many issues may be stale)\n   - If actionable: create local commits with fixes/features\n   - If unclear: prepare question for maintainer\n\n5. Plan Mode Constraints (CRITICAL)\n   - DO NOT run gh issue comment, gh issue close, gh pr comment, etc.\n   - DO NOT push any changes\n   - Only use gh for READ operations (view, list)\n   - All mutations will be applied by ru in a separate phase\n\n6.
