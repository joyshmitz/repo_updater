# Extending ru for Automated Reviews of GitHub Issues and PRs Using Claude Code

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive system for automating the review of GitHub issues and pull requests across multiple repositories using Claude Code as the AI agent. The goal is to transform a manual, time-consuming process into an orchestrated workflow that only surfaces decisions requiring human judgment.

**Key Innovation**: By leveraging Claude Code's stream-json output mode, ntm's sophisticated activity detection (velocity-based state classification with hysteresis), and a priority-scored question queue, we can process dozens of repositories in parallel while presenting a unified, intuitive interface for human decision-making.

## 1. Background: What is ru?

### 1.1 Overview

**ru (Repo Updater)** is a pure Bash CLI tool (~3,800 lines) for synchronizing GitHub repositories. It provides a beautiful, automation-friendly interface for managing collections of repositories - cloning new ones, pulling updates, checking status, and maintaining configuration.

### 1.2 Core Capabilities

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sync` | Clone missing repos and pull updates for existing ones |
| `status` | Show repository status without making changes |
| `import` | Import repos from files with auto visibility detection |
| `prune` | Find and manage orphan repositories |
| `add/remove` | Manage repository list |
| `self-update` | Update ru with checksum verification |
| `doctor` | System diagnostics |

### 1.3 Technical Implementation

ru is implemented as a single Bash script (`ru`) with these characteristics:

```bash
# Core design principles
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -uo pipefail  # NOT set -e (explicit error handling)

# Key architectural patterns:
# - XDG Base Directory Specification compliance
# - Git plumbing commands (not porcelain) for reliable status
# - Flock-based parallel sync work queue
# - NDJSON output for results tracking
# - Gum integration with ANSI fallback for TUI
# - Nameref-based function output (Bash 4.3+)
```

### 1.4 Configuration Structure

```
~/.config/ru/
├── config                 # Main configuration (PROJECTS_DIR, LAYOUT, etc.)
└── repos.d/
    ├── repos.txt          # Primary repository list
    ├── work.txt           # Work repositories
    └── personal.txt       # Personal projects

~/.local/state/ru/
├── sync-state.json        # Resume state for interrupted syncs
├── review-state.json      # Review tracking (NEW)
└── logs/                  # Operation logs
```

### 1.5 Repository Specification Format

```bash
# Basic formats
owner/repo                      # GitHub shorthand
owner/repo@develop              # Branch pinning
owner/repo as myname            # Custom local directory name
owner/repo@main as custom       # Combined

# Full URLs
https://github.com/owner/repo   # HTTPS
git@github.com:owner/repo       # SSH
https://gitlab.com/owner/repo   # Non-GitHub hosts
```

## 2. The Problem We're Solving

### 2.1 The Maintainer's Dilemma

Developers who create many open-source projects face an impossible scaling problem:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Volume** | Dozens or hundreds of repositories across domains |
| **Bandwidth** | No time for manual review of issues and PRs |
| **Quality** | Still want to maintain quality and respond to users |
| **Risk** | External contributions carry responsibility |
| **Context Switching** | Each repo requires deep understanding |
| **Staleness** | Issues become outdated as code evolves |

### 2.2 The Contribution Policy

The maintainer has adopted this policy (disclosed to users):

> *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.

### 2.3 Key Principles

1. **No Direct PR Merges**: External code is never merged directly
2. **Independent Verification**: AI validates independently - never trust user claims
3. **AI as Implementation**: Good ideas are implemented from scratch by AI
4. **Human Judgment for Direction**: Maintainer decides features/scope
5. **AI as Communicator**: AI responds via `gh` on maintainer's behalf
6. **Date Awareness**: Many issues are stale - check against recent commits

---

## 3. Current Manual Workflow

### 3.1 Step-by-Step Process

For each repository with open issues or PRs:

```bash
# 1. Navigate and update
cd ~/projects/myproject
git pull

# 2. Launch Claude Code
cc    # alias for claude-code CLI

# 3. Send codebase understanding prompt (wait ~5 min)
# 4. Send issue/PR review prompt (wait ~10-20 min)
# 5. Handle interactive questions from Claude
# 6. Repeat for next project
```

### 3.2 The Prompts

**Prompt 1: Codebase Understanding (Incremental Digest)**
```
First read ALL of AGENTS.md and README.md carefully.

If a prior repo digest exists at .ru/repo-digest.md, read it first.
Then update it based on changes since last review:
  • inspect git log since the last review timestamp
  • inspect changed files and any new architecture decisions

If no prior digest exists, create a comprehensive repo digest covering:
  • Project purpose and architecture
  • Key files and modules
  • Patterns and conventions used

Write the updated digest to .ru/repo-digest.md.
Use ultrathink.
```

**Prompt 2: Issue/PR Review**
```
We don't allow PRs or outside contributions to this project as a matter
of policy; here is the policy disclosed to users:

> *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do
not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't
have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the
thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the
risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to
worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly
make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if
you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them
directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh`
and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in
particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid
wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the
prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but
it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.

But I want you to now use the `gh` utility to review all open issues and
PRs and to independently read and review each of these carefully; without
trusting or relying on any of the user reports being correct, or their
suggested/proposed changes or "fixes" being correct, I want you to do
your own totally separate and independent verification and validation.
You can use the stuff from users as possible inspiration, but everything
has to come from your own mind and/or official documentation and the
actual code and empirical, independent evidence. Note that MANY of these
are likely out of date because I made tons of fixes and changes already;
it's important to look at the dates and subsequent commits. Use ultrathink.
After you have reviewed things carefully and taken actions in response
(including implementing possible fixes or new features), you can respond
on my behalf using `gh`.

Just a reminder: we do NOT accept ANY PRs. You can look at them to see if
they contain good ideas but even then you must check with me first before
integrating even ideas because they could take the project into another
direction I don't like or introduce scope creep. Use ultrathink.
```

### 3.3 Pain Points

| Pain Point | Impact | Frequency |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Time per repo | 10-20+ minutes, fully attended | Every repo |
| Context switching | Mental overhead between projects | Constant |
| Interruption-driven | Claude asks questions needing immediate response | Frequent |
| No aggregation | Questions from different repos not consolidated | Always |
| No prioritization | Can't prioritize which repos need attention first | Always |
| No persistence | Must restart if interrupted | Occasionally |
| Session degradation | Claude slows down over long sessions | After 8-12 exchanges |

## 5. Architecture Options Analysis

### 5.1 Option A: Pure Bash Extension

**Approach**: Extend `ru` with a new `review` subcommand entirely in Bash.

```bash
# Implementation sketch
cmd_review() {
    local repos_with_issues=()

    # Scan repos for open issues/PRs
    while IFS= read -r repo_spec; do
        local issue_count pr_count
        issue_count=$(gh issue list -R "$repo" --state open --json number | jq length)
        pr_count=$(gh pr list -R "$repo" --state open --json number | jq length)

        if [[ $((issue_count + pr_count)) -gt 0 ]]; then
            repos_with_issues+=("$repo_spec")
        fi
    done < <(get_all_repos)

    # Process each repo sequentially
    for repo in "${repos_with_issues[@]}"; do
        # Launch tmux session with Claude Code
        # Send prompts via tmux send-keys
        # Poll for questions using output pattern matching
        # Show questions via gum
    done
}
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Keeps ru as pure Bash (consistent with existing codebase) | Bash awkward for complex TUI interactions |
| No new dependencies beyond what ru already uses | Limited concurrency control |
| Simple deployment (single script) | Output parsing is fragile |
| | No real-time monitoring |
| | Would reinvent functionality that exists elsewhere (ntm) |
| | Hard to maintain as complexity grows |

**Verdict**: ❌ Not recommended for full implementation, but useful for basic functionality.

### 5.2 Option B: Standalone Go/Rust Helper Binary

**Approach**: Create `ru-review` as a separate binary that ru calls.

```go
// ru-review/main.go sketch
func main() {
    repos := scanForActivity()
    sessions := make(map[string]*Session)

    for _, repo := range repos {
        session := launchClaudeSession(repo)
        sessions[repo] = session
        go monitorSession(session)
    }

    runTUI(sessions)
}
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Proper TUI support (using tview, bubbletea, etc.) | New codebase to maintain |
| Better output parsing and state management | Duplicates functionality from ntm |
| Good concurrency primitives | More complex build and installation |
| Type safety and better error handling | Different language from ru (coordination overhead) |

**Verdict**: ⚠️ Reasonable but suboptimal given ntm exists.

### 5.3 Option C: Deep ntm Integration

**Approach**: Use ntm as the orchestration engine, ru as the repo management layer.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Leverages mature, tested orchestration code (~29K lines of Go) | Adds ntm as dependency |
| Beautiful TUI already exists (command palette, dashboard) | Requires ntm installation and configuration |
| Health monitoring, auto-restart, activity detection | More complex initial setup |
| Robot mode enables Bash→Go communication | Two-language coordination (Bash + Go) |
| Workflow pipelines for complex sequences | |
| Session persistence across disconnections | |

**Verdict**: ✅ **Recommended** - leverages existing sophisticated tooling.

### 5.4 Option D: Hybrid with Graceful Degradation

**Approach**: Works with or without ntm.

- **Without ntm**: Sequential processing, gum-based TUI, basic functionality
- **With ntm**: Full parallel processing, rich dashboard, advanced features

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Works for all users | Two code paths to maintain |
| Enhanced experience with ntm | More testing required |
| Gradual adoption path | |

**Verdict**: ✅ **Selected** - Best balance of accessibility and power.

            handle_rate_limit "$session_name" "$rate_limited"
        fi

        sleep 10
    done
}
```

#### 7.3.2 Activity State Detection

ntm provides velocity-based activity detection with these thresholds:

```go
// From ntm internal/robot/activity.go
const (
    VelocityHighThreshold   = 10.0  // chars/sec - active generation
    VelocityMediumThreshold = 2.0   // chars/sec - some activity
    VelocityIdleThreshold   = 1.0   // chars/sec - considered idle
    DefaultStallThreshold   = 30 * time.Second
)
```

State classification priority:
1. **ERROR** (0.95 confidence): Error patterns detected immediately
2. **WAITING** (0.90 confidence): Idle prompt + velocity < 1.0 chars/sec
3. **THINKING** (0.80 confidence): Thinking indicators (spinners, "thinking...")
4. **GENERATING** (0.85 confidence): velocity > 10.0 chars/sec
5. **STALLED** (0.75 confidence): velocity == 0 for > 30 seconds while generating
6. **UNKNOWN** (0.50 confidence): Insufficient signals

### 7.4 Phase 4: TUI and Polish (Week 4-5)

See Section 12 for detailed TUI design.

## 8. Technical Deep Dive: Claude Code Automation

### 8.1 Claude Code Modes

| Mode | Command | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| Interactive | `claude` | Normal human interaction |
| Headless/Print | `claude -p "prompt"` | Scriptable, non-interactive |
| Stream JSON | `claude -p "..." --output-format stream-json` | Programmatic monitoring |

### 8.2 Stream-JSON Event Types

```json
// Initialization
{"type":"system","subtype":"init","session_id":"abc123","tools":["Read","Write","Edit","Bash",...]}

// Assistant message with text
{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"I'll analyze..."}]}}

// Assistant using a tool
{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_123","name":"Read","input":{"file_path":"/path/to/file"}}]}}

// Tool result
{"type":"user","message":{"content":[{"type":"tool_result","tool_use_id":"toolu_123","content":"file contents..."}]}}

// AskUserQuestion tool (CRITICAL for our use case)
{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[
  {"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_456","name":"AskUserQuestion","input":{
    "questions":[{
      "question":"Should I refactor the entire auth module or just fix the specific bug?",
      "header":"Approach",
      "options":[
        {"label":"Quick fix","description":"Fix only the reported bug (5 lines)"},
        {"label":"Full refactor","description":"Modernize entire auth module (200+ lines)"},
        {"label":"Skip","description":"Not a priority right now"}
      ],
      "multiSelect":false
    }]
  }}
]}}

// Session complete
{"type":"result","status":"success","duration_ms":45000,"session_id":"abc123"}
```

### 8.3 Key Automation Patterns

```bash
# Pattern 1: Detect AskUserQuestion in stream
detect_question() {
    local line="$1"
    echo "$line" | jq -e '.message.content[]? | select(.name == "AskUserQuestion")' >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# Pattern 2: Extract question for display
format_question_for_display() {
    local question_json="$1"
    local repo_name="$2"

    local question options_text
    question=$(echo "$question_json" | jq -r '.questions[0].question')

    # Format options
    options_text=""
    local i=0
    while IFS= read -r opt; do
        local label desc
        label=$(echo "$opt" | jq -r '.label')
        desc=$(echo "$opt" | jq -r '.description // ""')
        options_text+="  $((++i))) $label"
        [[ -n "$desc" ]] && options_text+=" - $desc"
        options_text+=$'\n'
    done < <(echo "$question_json" | jq -c '.questions[0].options[]')

    cat << EOF
Repository: $repo_name

$question

Options:
$options_text
EOF
}

# Pattern 3: Send answer back to session
send_answer_to_session() {
    local session_id="$1"
    local pane_id="$2"
    local answer="$3"

    # Use ntm robot mode to send
    ntm --robot-send="$session_id" \
        --pane="$pane_id" \
        --msg="$answer"
}
```

### 8.4 Known Limitations and Workarounds

| Limitation | Workaround |
|------------|------------|
| `--output-format stream-json` may miss final event | Poll for completion, set timeout |
| Sessions degrade after 8-12 exchanges | Use `/compact` or start fresh |
| Rate limits (429) | Exponential backoff, rotate between sessions |
| Long thinking periods (10+ min) | Set `--max-turns`, implement timeout |
| Slash commands not available in `-p` mode | Describe task instead |

### 8.5 Review Plan Artifact (Required Output Contract)

Each repo review session MUST produce a machine-readable plan file at:
  `.ru/review-plan.json`

This file is the **single source of truth** for what happened in the session.
ru uses it to:
- Drive the Apply phase (push + gh mutations)
- Resume safely after interruption
- Compute metrics without transcript scraping
- Audit what was done

**Location (absolute):**
```
{worktree}/.ru/review-plan.json
```

**Schema (v1):**

Top-level contract notes:
- `schema_version` is an integer and must be `1` for this version.
- `repo` is `owner/repo` (GitHub shorthand).
- `worktree_path` is the absolute path of the isolated worktree for this repo.
- `items` must exist (may be empty if nothing was reviewed).
- `metadata` must exist (at minimum timestamps + model/driver info).

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "run_id": "20250104-103000-12345",
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "worktree_path": "/home/user/.local/state/ru/worktrees/20250104-103000-12345/owner_repo",

## 9. Technical Deep Dive: ntm Integration

### 9.1 Robot Mode API Reference

| Command | Output Type | Key Fields |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `--robot-status` | StatusOutput | sessions, agents, system info |
| `--robot-health=session` | HealthOutput | agent health matrix, alerts |
| `--robot-activity=paneID` | ActivityOutput | state, velocity, confidence |
| `--robot-route=session` | RouteOutput | best pane recommendation |
| `--robot-send` | SendOutput | delivery confirmation |
| `--robot-snapshot=session` | SnapshotOutput | full pane state |

### 9.2 Health Monitoring

ntm detects these conditions automatically:

| Condition | Detection | Recovery |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Stall** | No output for 5+ minutes | Soft restart (Ctrl+C) |
| **Rate Limit** | Pattern: "rate limit", "429", "quota exceeded" | Backoff + alert |
| **Crash** | Pattern: "panic:", "SIGSEGV", "killed" | Auto-restart |
| **Auth Failure** | Pattern: "unauthorized", "invalid.*key" | Alert user |
| **Network Error** | Pattern: "connection refused", "timed out" | Retry with backoff |

      POLICY: We don't allow PRs or outside contributions. The maintainer's
      disclosed policy:

      > *About Contributions:* I do not accept outside contributions. I don't
      have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the
      thing. Feel free to submit issues and PRs to illustrate fixes, but I
      won't merge them directly. Claude will review and independently decide
      whether and how to address them. Bug reports are welcome.

      TASK: Review the following work items using `gh` to read details:
      ${inputs.work_items}

      For each item:
      1. Read the issue/PR independently via `gh issue view` or `gh pr view`
      2. Verify claims independently - don't trust user reports blindly
      3. Check dates against recent commits (many issues may be stale)
      4. If actionable: create local commits with fixes/features
      5. If needs clarification: prepare a question for the maintainer

      CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS:
      - DO NOT run `gh issue comment`, `gh issue close`, `gh pr comment`, etc.
      - DO NOT push any changes
      - Only use `gh` for READ operations (view, list)
      - All mutations will be applied by ru in a separate phase

      REQUIRED OUTPUT:
      You MUST produce a structured review plan artifact at:
        .ru/review-plan.json

### 9.6 Question Context Extraction (ntm Go Code)

```go
// Extract relevant context around a question
func ExtractQuestionContext(output string, maxLines int) string {
    lines := strings.Split(output, "\n")

    // Find the question line
    questionIdx := -1
    for i := len(lines) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
        if isQuestionLine(lines[i]) {
            questionIdx = i
            break
        }
    }

    if questionIdx == -1 {
        // No question found, return last N lines
        start := max(0, len(lines)-maxLines)
        return strings.Join(lines[start:], "\n")
    }

    // Get context before and after question
    start := max(0, questionIdx-10)
    end := min(len(lines), questionIdx+5)

    return strings.Join(lines[start:end], "\n")
}
```

### 9.7 Answer Routing (ntm Go Code)

```go
// Route answer back to appropriate session
func RouteAnswer(question *Question, answer string) error {
    // Get the tmux pane
    pane, err := tmux.GetPane(question.SessionID, question.PaneID)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Send the answer
    return pane.SendKeys(answer + "\n")
}
```

### 9.8 Activity Detection (ntm Go Code + Wait Reasons)

```go
// Activity states for Claude Code
const (

)

// Wait reasons: WHY the system believes we are waiting
// This is critical for proper question routing and UX
const (
    WaitAskUserQuestion = "ask_user_question"  // Structured tool call detected
    WaitAgentQuestion   = "agent_question_text" // Text-based question at prompt
    WaitExternalPrompt  = "external_prompt"     // Shell, git, auth prompt
    WaitUnknown         = "unknown"             // Waiting but reason unclear
)

// WaitInfo provides context about why a session is waiting
type WaitInfo struct {
    Reason      string   // One of Wait* constants
    Context     string   // Relevant output context
    Options     []string // Detected options if any
    Recommended string   // Suggested response if determinable
    RiskLevel   string   // low, medium, high
}

// Detection heuristics with wait reason extraction
func DetectClaudeState(pane *Pane) (state string, waitInfo *WaitInfo) {
    output := pane.CaptureLastN(50)  // Last 50 lines
    velocity := pane.OutputVelocity()
    lastActivity := pane.LastActivityTime()

    // Check for error patterns first (highest priority)
    if containsErrorPattern(output) {
        return StateError, nil
    }

    // Check for stall (no output for 5+ minutes while previously active)
    if velocity == 0 && time.Since(lastActivity) > 5*time.Minute {
        return StateStalled, nil
    }

    // Check for waiting state with reason detection
    if velocity < 1.0 && containsPromptPattern(output) {

## 10. Performance Optimization Strategies

### 10.1 GitHub API Optimization (GraphQL Alias Batching)

Note: Discovery now uses true GraphQL alias batching (see Section 7.1.2).
This replaces the per-repo O(n) approach with chunked batch queries.

```bash
# GraphQL alias batching is implemented in gh_api_graphql_repo_batch()
# Key benefits:
# - 10-100× fewer API calls
# - Single round-trip per chunk of 25 repos
# - Returns all metadata needed for scoring in one response

# Cache discovery results (invalidated on config change)
CACHE_TTL_DISCOVERY=300  # 5 minutes
get_discovery_cache_key() {
    # Hash of repo list + config
    local config_hash
    config_hash=$(get_config_hash)
    echo "discovery-${config_hash}"
}
```

### 10.2 Parallel Session Management

```bash
# Initial parallelism calculation (adjusted by governor)
calculate_optimal_parallelism() {
    local total_repos="$1"

    # The real source of truth is the rate-limit governor (see 10.2.1)
    # This provides a starting point

    # Factors:
    # - API rate limits (read from gh api rate_limit, not guessed)
    # - Claude rate limits (detected via 429 responses)
    # - System resources (memory, CPU)
    # - Context quality (too many sessions = divided attention)

    local max_by_resources=8        # Based on typical system
    local max_by_quality=6          # Optimal for attention

    local optimal=$((total_repos < max_by_quality ? total_repos : max_by_quality))
    optimal=$((optimal < max_by_resources ? optimal : max_by_resources))

    echo "$optimal"
}
```

### 10.2.1 Adaptive Rate-Limit Governor (GitHub + Model)

The scheduler runs with a governor that dynamically adjusts concurrency based on
real rate limit data, not static heuristics.

```bash
# Governor state
declare -A GOVERNOR_STATE=(
    [github_remaining]=5000
    [github_reset]=0
    [model_in_backoff]=false
    [model_backoff_until]=0
    [effective_parallelism]=4
    [circuit_breaker_open]=false
)

# Start governor loop (runs in background during review)
start_rate_limit_governor() {
    local check_interval=30  # seconds

    while [[ -f "$RU_STATE_DIR/review.lock" ]]; do
        update_github_rate_limit
        check_model_rate_limit
        adjust_parallelism
        sleep "$check_interval"
    done &
    GOVERNOR_PID=$!
}

# Query actual GitHub rate limit
update_github_rate_limit() {
    local rate_info
    rate_info=$(gh api rate_limit 2>/dev/null) || return 1

    GOVERNOR_STATE[github_remaining]=$(echo "$rate_info" | jq '.resources.core.remaining')
    GOVERNOR_STATE[github_reset]=$(echo "$rate_info" | jq '.resources.core.reset')

    # Check if approaching limit
    if [[ ${GOVERNOR_STATE[github_remaining]} -lt 500 ]]; then
        log_warn "GitHub API rate limit low: ${GOVERNOR_STATE[github_remaining]} remaining"
        GOVERNOR_STATE[effective_parallelism]=1
    fi
}

# Detect model rate limits from session streams
check_model_rate_limit() {
    local now
    now=$(date +%s)

    # Check for recent 429 errors in session logs
    local recent_429s
    recent_429s=$(grep -l "rate.limit\|429\|quota.exceeded" \
        "$RU_STATE_DIR/worktrees/$REVIEW_RUN_ID"/*/.ru/session.log 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

    if [[ $recent_429s -gt 2 ]]; then
        GOVERNOR_STATE[model_in_backoff]=true
        GOVERNOR_STATE[model_backoff_until]=$((now + 60))
        log_warn "Model rate limit detected, backing off for 60s"
    elif [[ ${GOVERNOR_STATE[model_in_backoff]} == "true" ]] && \
         [[ $now -gt ${GOVERNOR_STATE[model_backoff_until]} ]]; then
        GOVERNOR_STATE[model_in_backoff]=false
    fi
}

# Adjust parallelism based on current conditions
adjust_parallelism() {
    local target=${REVIEW_PARALLEL:-4}

    # Reduce if GitHub rate limit low
    if [[ ${GOVERNOR_STATE[github_remaining]} -lt 1000 ]]; then
        target=$((target / 2))
        [[ $target -lt 1 ]] && target=1
    fi

    # Reduce if model in backoff
    if [[ ${GOVERNOR_STATE[model_in_backoff]} == "true" ]]; then
        target=1
    fi

    # Circuit breaker: too many errors in sliding window
    local recent_errors
    recent_errors=$(count_recent_session_errors 300)  # last 5 minutes
    if [[ $recent_errors -gt 5 ]]; then
        GOVERNOR_STATE[circuit_breaker_open]=true
        target=0
        log_error "Circuit breaker open: too many errors, pausing new sessions"
    fi

    GOVERNOR_STATE[effective_parallelism]=$target
}

# Called by scheduler before starting new session
can_start_new_session() {
    [[ ${GOVERNOR_STATE[circuit_breaker_open]} == "true" ]] && return 1
    [[ ${GOVERNOR_STATE[model_in_backoff]} == "true" ]] && return 1

    local active_sessions
    active_sessions=$(count_active_sessions)
    [[ $active_sessions -ge ${GOVERNOR_STATE[effective_parallelism]} ]] && return 1

    return 0
}
```

### 10.3 Pre-fetching Strategy

```bash
# While reviewing repo N, pre-fetch data for repo N+1, N+2
prefetch_next_repos() {
    local current_index="$1"
    local repos=("${@:2}")
    local prefetch_count=2

    for ((i=1; i<=prefetch_count; i++)); do
        local next_index=$((current_index + i))
        if [[ $next_index -lt ${#repos[@]} ]]; then
            local next_repo="${repos[next_index]}"

            # Background fetch
            (
                get_repo_activity_cached "$next_repo" >/dev/null
                # Also warm git fetch
                local local_path
                local_path=$(get_repo_local_path "$next_repo")
                [[ -d "$local_path" ]] && git -C "$local_path" fetch --quiet 2>/dev/null
            ) &
        fi
    done
}
```

### 10.4 Smart Session Reuse

```bash
# Reuse existing Claude sessions when possible
get_or_create_session() {
    local repo_path="$1"
    local session_id="$2"

    # Check for existing session with context
    if ntm --robot-status 2>/dev/null | jq -e ".sessions[\"$session_id\"]" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        local context_usage
        context_usage=$(ntm --robot-activity="$session_id:1" 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.context_usage // 100')

        if (( $(echo "$context_usage < 70" | bc -l) )); then
            # Reuse existing session
            echo "$session_id"
            return 0
        fi
    fi

    # Create new session
    create_new_session "$repo_path" "$session_id"
}
```

## 11. Priority Scoring Algorithm

### 11.1 Score Components

```python
# Pseudo-code for clarity (implemented in Bash)

def calculate_priority_score(repo):
    score = 0

    # Component 1: Issue/PR Volume (0-100 points)
    score += min(repo.open_issues * 10, 50)
    score += min(repo.open_prs * 20, 50)

    # Component 2: Label-Based Priority (0-100 points)
    for label in repo.labels:
        if label in ['security', 'critical']:
            score += 50
        elif label in ['bug', 'urgent']:
            score += 30
        elif label in ['enhancement', 'feature']:
            score += 10

    # Component 3: Age Factor (0-50 points)
    oldest_issue_days = repo.get_oldest_issue_age_days()
    if oldest_issue_days > 60:
        score += 50
    elif oldest_issue_days > 30:
        score += 30
    elif oldest_issue_days > 14:
        score += 15

    # Component 4: Staleness Penalty (0-40 points)
    days_since_review = repo.get_days_since_last_review()
    if days_since_review > 60:
        score += 40
    elif days_since_review > 30:
        score += 25
    elif days_since_review > 14:
        score += 10

    # Component 5: Engagement Signal (0-30 points)
    # High engagement = users care about this repo
    recent_comments = repo.get_comment_count_last_7_days()
    if recent_comments > 10:
        score += 30
    elif recent_comments > 5:
        score += 15
    elif recent_comments > 0:
        score += 5

    # Component 6: PR vs Issue Preference (0-20 points)
    # PRs indicate someone invested effort
    if repo.open_prs > 0:
        score += 20

    return score
```

### 11.2 Priority Thresholds

| Score Range | Priority Level | Color | Behavior |
|-------------|----------------|-------|----------|
| 150+ | CRITICAL | Red | Process immediately |
| 100-149 | HIGH | Orange | Process in first batch |
| 50-99 | NORMAL | Yellow | Process when capacity available |
| 0-49 | LOW | Gray | Process last or skip if `--skip-low` |

### 11.3 Bash Implementation

### 12.4.1 Snooze Feature

Snooze allows deferring items without skipping them permanently:

```bash
# Snooze durations
SNOOZE_1D=86400      # 1 day
SNOOZE_7D=604800     # 7 days
SNOOZE_30D=2592000   # 30 days

snooze_item() {
    local item_key="$1"
    local duration="$2"

    local until_ts
    until_ts=$(($(date +%s) + duration))

    write_json_atomic "$RU_STATE_DIR/snoozed.json" \
        "$(jq --arg key "$item_key" --arg until "$until_ts" \
            '.[$key] = $until' "$RU_STATE_DIR/snoozed.json")"
}

is_snoozed() {
    local item_key="$1"
    local now
    now=$(date +%s)

    local until_ts
    until_ts=$(jq -r --arg key "$item_key" '.[$key] // 0' "$RU_STATE_DIR/snoozed.json")

    [[ $until_ts -gt $now ]]
}
```

### 12.4.2 Response Templates

Pre-configured responses for common patterns:

```bash
# ~/.config/ru/templates/
# ├── stale-issue.md
# ├── duplicate.md
# ├── needs-info.md
# ├── wontfix.md
# └── thank-you.md

load_response_templates() {
    local templates_dir="$RU_CONFIG_DIR/templates"
    declare -gA RESPONSE_TEMPLATES

    for file in "$templates_dir"/*.md; do
        [[ -f "$file" ]] || continue
        local name="${file##*/}"
        name="${name%.md}"
        RESPONSE_TEMPLATES["$name"]=$(cat "$file")
    done
}

show_template_picker() {
    local selected
    selected=$(printf '%s\n' "${!RESPONSE_TEMPLATES[@]}" | gum choose)
    echo "${RESPONSE_TEMPLATES[$selected]}"
}
```

### 12.4.3 Bulk Apply (Safe Approvals)

Apply all low-risk changes that pass quality gates:

```bash
bulk_apply_safe() {
    local -a safe_plans=()

    # Find plans that are safe to auto-apply
    for plan_file in "$RU_STATE_DIR/worktrees/$REVIEW_RUN_ID"/*/.ru/review-plan.json; do
        [[ -f "$plan_file" ]] || continue

        local risk_level tests_ok
        risk_level=$(jq -r '.git.tests.risk_level // "medium"' "$plan_file")
        tests_ok=$(jq -r '.git.tests.ok // false' "$plan_file")

        # Only auto-apply if:
        # - All items are low-risk
        # - Tests ran and passed
        # - No unanswered questions
        if [[ "$risk_level" == "low" ]] && [[ "$tests_ok" == "true" ]]; then
            local unanswered
            unanswered=$(jq '[.questions[] | select(.answered != true)] | length' "$plan_file")
            if [[ $unanswered -eq 0 ]]; then
                safe_plans+=("$plan_file")
            fi
        fi
    done

    if [[ ${#safe_plans[@]} -eq 0 ]]; then
        log_info "No plans qualify for bulk apply"
        return 0
    fi

    log_info "Found ${#safe_plans[@]} plans eligible for bulk apply"

    if gum_confirm "Apply ${#safe_plans[@]} safe plans?"; then
        for plan_file in "${safe_plans[@]}"; do
            local wt_path="${plan_file%/.ru/review-plan.json}"
            apply_single_plan "$wt_path" "$plan_file"
        done
    fi
}
```

### 12.4.4 Patch Summary View

Show what changed before approving:

```bash
show_patch_summary() {
    local plan_file="$1"
    local wt_path="${plan_file%/.ru/review-plan.json}"

    # Extract summary from plan
    local branch commits_count files_changed lines_added lines_removed test_status

    branch=$(jq -r '.git.branch' "$plan_file")
    commits_count=$(jq '.git.commits | length' "$plan_file")
    test_status=$(jq -r 'if .git.tests.ok then "PASS" else "FAIL" end' "$plan_file")

    # Get diff stats
    local diff_stat
    diff_stat=$(git -C "$wt_path" diff --stat HEAD~"$commits_count"..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "No changes")

    gum style --border rounded --padding "1 2" << EOF
PATCH SUMMARY: $(basename "$wt_path")
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Branch: $branch
Commits: $commits_count
Tests: $test_status

Changed Files:
$diff_stat

Items Addressed:
$(jq -r '.items[] | "  • \(.type) #\(.number): \(.decision)"' "$plan_file")

gh_actions Pending:
$(jq -r '.gh_actions[] | "  • \(.op) \(.target)"' "$plan_file")
EOF
}

### 12.5 Accessibility Considerations

```yaml
# Accessibility settings in ~/.config/ru/config
REVIEW_ACCESSIBLE_MODE="auto"  # auto, true, false
# When enabled:
# - No animations
# - High contrast colors
# - Screen reader hints
# - Simplified layout
# - Clear focus indicators
```

## 13. Error Handling and Recovery

### 13.1 Error Categories

| Category | Examples | Recovery Strategy |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Transient** | Network timeout, API 500 | Retry with exponential backoff |
| **Rate Limit** | API 429, Claude quota | Backoff, rotate sessions, alert |
| **Auth** | Token expired, invalid key | Alert user, pause session |
| **Session** | Claude crash, OOM | Auto-restart, preserve state |
| **User** | Invalid input, cancel | Graceful handling, resume |
| **Fatal** | Disk full, permissions | Abort with clear message |

### 13.2 Retry Strategy

```bash
# Exponential backoff with jitter
retry_with_backoff() {
    local cmd="$1"
    local max_attempts="${2:-5}"
    local base_delay="${3:-1}"

    local attempt=1
    while [[ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]]; do
        if eval "$cmd"; then
            return 0
        fi

        local delay=$((base_delay * (2 ** (attempt - 1))))
        # Add jitter (±25%)
        local jitter=$((delay / 4))
        delay=$((delay + RANDOM % (jitter * 2) - jitter))

        log_warn "Attempt $attempt failed, retrying in ${delay}s..."
        sleep "$delay"
        ((attempt++))
    done

    return 1
}
```

### 13.3 Session Recovery

```bash
# Checkpoint state periodically
checkpoint_review_state() {
    local state_file="$RU_STATE_DIR/review-checkpoint.json"

    local state
    state=$(cat << EOF
{
  "version": 1,
  "timestamp": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "run_id": "$REVIEW_RUN_ID",
  "mode": "$REVIEW_MODE",
  "repos_total": ${#REVIEW_REPOS[@]},
  "repos_completed": ${#COMPLETED_REPOS[@]},
  "repos_pending": $(printf '%s\n' "${PENDING_REPOS[@]}" | jq -R . | jq -s .),
  "questions_pending": $(echo "$QUESTIONS_JSON" | jq .),
  "sessions": $(get_active_sessions_json)
}
EOF
)
    echo "$state" > "$state_file"
}

# Resume from checkpoint
resume_from_checkpoint() {
    local checkpoint_file="$RU_STATE_DIR/review-checkpoint.json"

    if [[ ! -f "$checkpoint_file" ]]; then
        log_error "No checkpoint found to resume"
        return 1
    fi

    local state
    state=$(cat "$checkpoint_file")

    # Restore state
    REVIEW_RUN_ID=$(echo "$state" | jq -r '.run_id')
    REVIEW_MODE=$(echo "$state" | jq -r '.mode')

    # Restore pending repos
    PENDING_REPOS=()
    while IFS= read -r repo; do
        PENDING_REPOS+=("$repo")
    done < <(echo "$state" | jq -r '.repos_pending[]')

    log_info "Resumed from checkpoint: ${#PENDING_REPOS[@]} repos remaining"
}
```

### 13.4 Graceful Degradation

```bash
# Fallback chain for mode selection
select_best_mode() {
    # Try ntm first
    if command -v ntm &>/dev/null; then
        if ntm --robot-status &>/dev/null; then
            echo "ntm"
            return
        fi
        log_warn "ntm available but not responding, falling back"
    fi

    # Try stream-json mode
    if claude --version &>/dev/null; then
        echo "stream"
        return
    fi

    # Fall back to basic
    echo "basic"
}
```

## 14. Security Considerations

### 14.1 Authentication and Tokens

| Token | Storage | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|---------|------|------------|
| GitHub (gh) | gh's secure store | Medium | Use gh CLI, never store raw |
| Anthropic API | System keychain | High | Environment variable, not file |
| ntm sessions | Local only | Low | Tmux session security |

### 14.2 Code Execution Safety (Plan Mode Restrictions)

Claude operates under an explicit execution policy enforced by the workflow:

**Plan Mode (default):**
- Read/Write/Edit files in the isolated worktree only
- Run local commands (git, grep, make, npm test, etc.)
- `gh` is READ-ONLY: `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, `gh issue list` allowed
- `gh` MUTATIONS BLOCKED: `gh issue comment`, `gh issue close`, `gh pr merge` etc.
- NO direct push to remote
- All mutations are deferred to Apply phase

**Apply Mode (--apply):**
- ru (not the agent) executes approved actions from review-plan.json
- Quality gates run before any push
- Human confirmation required for high-risk operations

```bash
# Safe Bash command allowlist for agent
SAFE_BASH_COMMANDS=(
    "git" "grep" "rg" "ag" "find" "ls" "cat" "head" "tail"
    "make" "npm" "yarn" "pnpm" "cargo" "go" "python" "pytest"
    "shellcheck" "eslint" "prettier" "black" "ruff"
    "jq" "yq" "sed" "awk" "sort" "uniq" "wc" "diff"
)

# Commands that require human approval
APPROVAL_REQUIRED_COMMANDS=(
    "rm" "mv" "cp"  # File operations
    "curl" "wget"   # Network operations
    "docker" "kubectl"  # Container operations
)

# Blocked commands (never allowed)
BLOCKED_COMMANDS=(
    "sudo" "su"
    "chmod +x" "chown"
    "eval" "exec"
)

# Validate command before execution (called by pre-exec hook)
validate_agent_command() {
    local cmd="$1"
    local first_word="${cmd%% *}"

    # Check blocked list
    for blocked in "${BLOCKED_COMMANDS[@]}"; do
        if [[ "$cmd" == *"$blocked"* ]]; then
            log_error "Blocked command: $cmd"
            return 1
        fi
    done

    # Check gh mutations
    if [[ "$first_word" == "gh" ]]; then
        if echo "$cmd" | grep -qE 'comment|close|merge|label|edit|delete'; then
            log_error "gh mutations blocked in Plan mode: $cmd"
            return 1
        fi
    fi

    # Check approval required
    for approval in "${APPROVAL_REQUIRED_COMMANDS[@]}"; do
        if [[ "$first_word" == "$approval" ]]; then
            queue_command_approval_question "$cmd"
            return 2  # Pending approval
        fi
    done

    return 0
}
```

### 14.2.1 Quality Gates Before Push (Tests/Lint)

ru supports per-repo quality gates that must pass before pushing:

```bash
# Quality gate configuration (per-repo or global)
# ~/.config/ru/review-policies.d/<owner>_<repo>.conf
# or ~/.config/ru/config

# Example:
# REVIEW_TEST_CMD="make test"
# REVIEW_LINT_CMD="npm run lint"
# REVIEW_REQUIRE_TESTS=true

run_quality_gates() {
    local wt_path="$1"
    local plan_file="$2"

    # Load per-repo policy if exists
    local repo_id
    repo_id=$(jq -r '.repo' "$plan_file")
    local policy_file="$RU_CONFIG_DIR/review-policies.d/${repo_id//\//_}.conf"
    [[ -f "$policy_file" ]] && source "$policy_file"

    local test_cmd="${REVIEW_TEST_CMD:-}"
    local lint_cmd="${REVIEW_LINT_CMD:-}"
    local require_tests="${REVIEW_REQUIRE_TESTS:-false}"

    # Run lint if configured
    if [[ -n "$lint_cmd" ]]; then
        log_step "Running lint: $lint_cmd"
        if ! (cd "$wt_path" && eval "$lint_cmd"); then
            log_error "Lint failed"
            return 1
        fi
    fi

    # Run tests if configured
    if [[ -n "$test_cmd" ]]; then
        log_step "Running tests: $test_cmd"
        if ! (cd "$wt_path" && eval "$test_cmd"); then
            log_error "Tests failed"
            return 1
        fi
    elif [[ "$require_tests" == "true" ]]; then
        # Auto-detect test command
        if [[ -f "$wt_path/Makefile" ]] && grep -q "^test:" "$wt_path/Makefile"; then

### 14.3 Data Privacy

```bash
# What's logged (review-state.json)
# - Repo names (public info)
# - Issue/PR numbers (public info)
# - Decision metadata (your choices)
# - Timestamps

# What's NOT logged
# - Full issue content
# - PR code
# - API tokens
# - File contents
# - Session transcripts (stored separately with restricted permissions)
```

### 14.4 Rate Limit Management

```bash
# Track API usage to avoid rate limiting

## 16. Real-World Edge Cases

### 16.1 Stale Issues

**Scenario**: Issue reports bug that was already fixed.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Check issue date against recent commits
2. Search for related fixes in git log
3. Attempt to reproduce the bug
4. If fixed: Comment explaining fix commit, close issue
5. If still present: Proceed with fix
```

### 16.2 Duplicate Issues

**Scenario**: Multiple issues report same problem.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Search for similar issue titles/descriptions
2. Check if issues share keywords/symptoms
3. If duplicates found:
   - Keep oldest issue as primary
   - Comment on duplicates linking to primary
   - Close duplicates with "Duplicate of #X"
```

### 16.3 Can't Reproduce Bug

**Scenario**: Issue describes problem Claude can't verify.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Document reproduction attempts
2. Ask specific questions via gh comment:
   - OS/environment details
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Error messages/logs
3. Add "needs-info" label
4. Queue for follow-up in next review
```

### 16.4 Hostile/Rude Users

**Scenario**: User is aggressive or disrespectful.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Focus only on technical content
2. Respond professionally, ignore tone
3. If purely hostile with no content:
   - Close without engagement
   - Don't explain or justify
4. Flag for human review if threatening
```

### 16.5 Scope Creep in Feature Requests

**Scenario**: Feature request is large/invasive.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Acknowledge the idea's merits
2. Explain scope concerns
3. Ask maintainer for direction:
   "This would add 500+ lines and a new dependency.
    Options:
    a) Implement as proposed
    b) Implement minimal version
    c) Decline as out of scope"
```

### 16.6 PR with Good Idea, Bad Implementation

**Scenario**: PR concept is good but code is wrong.

```
Claude's approach:
1. Thank user for the idea
2. Explain the policy (no direct merges)
3. Describe what will happen:
   "I'll implement this independently,
    incorporating your concept with
    proper error handling/tests."
4. Implement from scratch
5. Credit user in commit message
6. Close PR referencing new commit
```

### 16.7 Security Vulnerability

**Scenario**: Issue reports security problem.

```
Claude's approach:
1. CRITICAL priority - process immediately
2. Verify independently
3. If valid:
   - Implement fix without public details
   - Coordinate disclosure with maintainer
   - Credit reporter appropriately
4. If not valid:
   - Explain why (without confirming specifics)
   - Thank for responsible disclosure attempt
```

| Output parsing errors | Low | Low | Pattern validation, graceful handling |

### 17.2 User Experience Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Information overload | Medium | Medium | Priority scoring, progressive disclosure |
| Lost context | Low | High | Full session drill-down, output logging |
| Accidental answers | Low | Medium | Confirmation for destructive actions |
| Interrupted sessions | Medium | Medium | State persistence, resume capability |

### 17.3 Operational Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Wrong fix deployed | Low | High | Dry-run mode, push confirmation |
| Offensive response | Very Low | High | Policy in prompt, human review flag |
| Missed security issue | Low | Critical | Security label priority boost |
| Over-automation | Medium | Medium | Human-in-the-loop for all decisions |

## Appendix C: State File Formats (Atomic + Item-Level)

State files use atomic writes with flock to prevent corruption from concurrent access
or interrupted writes. Item-level tracking enables accurate per-issue/PR analytics.

### C.0 State Locking

```bash
# Global lock for all state file operations
acquire_state_lock() {
    local lock_file="$RU_STATE_DIR/review.lock"
    exec 200>"$lock_file"
    flock -n 200 || return 1
}

release_state_lock() {
    flock -u 200 2>/dev/null || true
}

# Atomic JSON write helper
write_json_atomic() {
    local file="$1"
    local content="$2"
    local tmp_file="${file}.tmp.$$"

    echo "$content" > "$tmp_file"
    mv "$tmp_file" "$file"
}
```

      We don't allow PRs or outside contributions to this project as a matter
      of policy; here is the policy disclosed to users:

      > *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do
      not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't
      have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the
      thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the
      risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to
      worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly
      make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if
      you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them
      directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh`
      and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in
      particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid
      wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the
      prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but
      it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.

      But I want you to now use the `gh` utility to review all open issues and
      PRs and to independently read and review each of these carefully; without
      trusting or relying on any of the user reports being correct, or their
      suggested/proposed changes or "fixes" being correct, I want you to do
      your own totally separate and independent verification and validation.
      You can use the stuff from users as possible inspiration, but everything
      has to come from your own mind and/or official documentation and the
      actual code and empirical, independent evidence. Note that MANY of these
      are likely out of date because I made tons of fixes and changes already;
      it's important to look at the dates and subsequent commits. Use ultrathink.
      After you have reviewed things carefully and taken actions in response
      (including implementing possible fixes or new features), you can respond
      on my behalf using `gh`.

      Just a reminder: we do NOT accept ANY PRs. You can look at them to see if
      they contain good ideas but even then you must check with me first before
      integrating even ideas because they could take the project into another
      direction I don't like or introduce scope creep. Use ultrathink.

## Appendix F: Repo Digest Cache

The repo digest cache eliminates repetitive "understand the codebase" work by
maintaining a persistent summary of each repository.

### F.1 Digest Storage

```
~/.local/state/ru/repo-digests/
├── owner_repo.md          # Cached digest
├── owner_repo.meta.json   # Metadata (last update, commit range)
└── owner_other.md
```

### F.2 Digest Format

```markdown
# Repo Digest: owner/repo

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-04T10:30:00Z
**Commit Range:** abc123..def456
**Review Run:** 20250104-103000-12345

## Purpose
Brief description of what this project does.

## Architecture
- Main entry point: src/main.py
- Key modules: auth/, api/, models/
- Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy

## Patterns & Conventions
- Uses type hints throughout
- Tests in tests/ directory (pytest)
- CI: GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/)

## Recent Changes (since last review)

```

### F.3 Digest Update Logic

```bash
prepare_repo_digests() {
    local repos=("$@")

    for repo_info in "${repos[@]}"; do
        local repo_id wt_path
        get_worktree_mapping "$repo_info" repo_id wt_path

        local digest_cache="$RU_STATE_DIR/repo-digests/${repo_id//\//_}.md"
        local meta_cache="$RU_STATE_DIR/repo-digests/${repo_id//\//_}.meta.json"

        if [[ -f "$digest_cache" ]] && [[ -f "$meta_cache" ]]; then
            # Copy cached digest to worktree
            cp "$digest_cache" "$wt_path/.ru/repo-digest.md"

            # Record commit range for delta update
            local last_commit
            last_commit=$(jq -r '.last_commit' "$meta_cache")
            local current_commit
            current_commit=$(git -C "$wt_path" rev-parse HEAD)

            # Provide delta info to agent
            if [[ "$last_commit" != "$current_commit" ]]; then
                local changes
                changes=$(git -C "$wt_path" log --oneline "$last_commit".."$current_commit" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
                echo -e "\n## Changes Since Last Review\n$changes" >> "$wt_path/.ru/repo-digest.md"
            fi
        fi
    done
}

# After successful review, update cache
update_digest_cache() {
    local wt_path="$1"
    local repo_id="$2"

    local digest_file="$wt_path/.ru/repo-digest.md"
    if [[ -f "$digest_file" ]]; then
        local cache_dir="$RU_STATE_DIR/repo-digests"
        mkdir -p "$cache_dir"

        cp "$digest_file" "$cache_dir/${repo_id//\//_}.md"

        local current_commit
        current_commit=$(git -C "$wt_path" rev-parse HEAD)

        cat > "$cache_dir/${repo_id//\//_}.meta.json" << EOF
{
  "last_commit": "$current_commit",
  "last_update": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "run_id": "$REVIEW_RUN_ID"
}
EOF
    fi
}
```

## Appendix G: Testing & Verification

### G.1 Bash Unit Tests (bats)

Key areas requiring comprehensive tests:

```bash
# test/test_graphql_batching.bats

@test "gh_api_graphql_repo_batch generates valid query" {
    local chunk=$'owner1/repo1\nowner2/repo2'
    local query
    query=$(gh_api_graphql_repo_batch "$chunk" --dry-run)

    [[ "$query" == *"repo0: repository(owner:\"owner1\", name:\"repo1\")"* ]]
    [[ "$query" == *"repo1: repository(owner:\"owner2\", name:\"repo2\")"* ]]
}

@test "calculate_item_priority_score returns expected scores" {
    # Security label should score highest
    local score
    score=$(calculate_item_priority_score "issue" "security,bug" "2024-12-01" "2025-01-01" "false")
    [[ $score -ge 80 ]]

    # Draft PR should score lower
    score=$(calculate_item_priority_score "pr" "enhancement" "2024-12-01" "2025-01-01" "true")
    [[ $score -lt 30 ]]
}

@test "write_json_atomic is atomic" {
    local file="$BATS_TMPDIR/test.json"
    echo '{"version":1}' > "$file"

    # Simulate concurrent write
    (
        sleep 0.1
        write_json_atomic "$file" '{"version":2}'
    ) &

    write_json_atomic "$file" '{"version":3}'
    wait

    # File should be valid JSON (not corrupted)
    jq empty "$file"
}
```

### G.2 Test Fixtures

Store NDJSON fixture streams for parsing tests:

```
test/fixtures/
├── claude_stream/
│   ├── basic_session.ndjson
│   ├── ask_user_question.ndjson
│   ├── external_prompt.ndjson
│   └── error_session.ndjson
├── gh/
│   ├── graphql_batch_response.json
│   ├── rate_limit_response.json
│   └── issue_list.json
└── plans/
    ├── simple_fix.json
    ├── multiple_items.json
    └── with_questions.json
```

### G.3 Integration Smoke Tests

```bash
# test/integration/test_review_flow.sh

setup() {
    # Create sandbox repos
    SANDBOX="$BATS_TMPDIR/sandbox"
    mkdir -p "$SANDBOX"

    # Create test repo with fake issue
    create_test_repo "$SANDBOX/test-repo" "owner/test-repo"
}

@test "dry-run discovery finds test repo" {
    run ru review --dry-run --repos="owner/test-repo"
    [[ $status -eq 0 ]]
    [[ "$output" == *"test-repo"* ]]
}

@test "plan mode creates artifacts without pushing" {
    run ru review --mode=local --repos="owner/test-repo" --plan
    [[ $status -eq 0 ]]

    # Verify worktree was created
    [[ -d "$RU_STATE_DIR/worktrees"/*/"owner_test-repo" ]]

    # Verify plan artifact exists
    [[ -f "$RU_STATE_DIR/worktrees"/*/"owner_test-repo/.ru/review-plan.json" ]]

    # Verify nothing was pushed
    local remote_head
    remote_head=$(git -C "$SANDBOX/test-repo" rev-parse origin/main)
    local local_head
    local_head=$(git -C "$SANDBOX/test-repo" rev-parse main)
    [[ "$remote_head" == "$local_head" ]]
}

@test "apply mode requires explicit flag" {
    # Run plan first
    ru review --mode=local --repos="owner/test-repo" --plan

    # Apply without --push should not push
    run ru review --apply --no-push
    [[ $status -eq 0 ]]

    # Verify gh_actions were NOT executed
    # (would require mocking gh)
}
```

### G.4 Mocking External Dependencies

```bash
# test/mocks/gh_mock.sh

# Set up mock gh command
setup_gh_mock() {
    export GH_MOCK_DIR="$BATS_TMPDIR/gh_mock"
    mkdir -p "$GH_MOCK_DIR"

    # Create mock gh script
    cat > "$GH_MOCK_DIR/gh" << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
case "$*" in
    "api rate_limit")
        cat "$GH_MOCK_DIR/responses/rate_limit.json"
        ;;
    "api graphql"*)
        cat "$GH_MOCK_DIR/responses/graphql.json"
        ;;
    "issue list"*)
        cat "$GH_MOCK_DIR/responses/issues.json"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Mock: unknown command: $*" >&2
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
EOF
    chmod +x "$GH_MOCK_DIR/gh"

    export PATH="$GH_MOCK_DIR:$PATH"
}
```

### G.5 Golden Plan Artifacts

Store expected plan outputs for regression testing:

```bash
@test "review produces expected plan for fixture repo" {
    # Run review on fixture
    ru review --mode=local --repos="fixture/simple-bug" --plan

    # Compare plan to golden file
    local plan_file
    plan_file=$(find "$RU_STATE_DIR/worktrees" -name "review-plan.json" | head -1)

    # Use jq to compare (ignore timestamps)
    local actual expected
    actual=$(jq 'del(.run_id, .git.commits[].sha)' "$plan_file")
    expected=$(jq 'del(.run_id, .git.commits[].sha)' "test/golden/simple-bug-plan.json")

    [[ "$actual" == "$expected" ]]
}
```
