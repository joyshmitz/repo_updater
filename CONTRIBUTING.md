# Contributing to ru

Bug reports and feature requests via [Issues](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/repo_updater/issues) are welcome.

**Pull requests will not be merged.** I review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. If your idea is adopted, it will be reimplemented from scratch. This isn't personal -- it's about keeping maintenance sustainable for a solo project.

Feel free to submit PRs to illustrate a proposed fix, but please understand they serve as reference material, not merge candidates.
